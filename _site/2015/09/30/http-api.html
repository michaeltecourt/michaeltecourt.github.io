  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Yet another blog post about what REST is.</p>

<p>Dr. Fielding you would have done us a huge favor by clarifying things earlier.</p>

<h2 id="misconceptions">Misconceptions</h2>

<p>Most people understand REST as being :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pretty URIs</li>
  <li>Using HTTP verbs to name “CRUD” operations</li>
  <li>Having a one-to-one mapping between data object and HTTP resource</li>
  <li>Using JSON as a media type</li>
</ul>

<p>False.</p>

<h2 id="a-tiny-bit-of-history">A tiny bit of history</h2>

<p>What we are doing right now is RPC over HTTP, using JSON as data format. 
Why ? because in programming, like mostly everywhere else in the history of mankind, easiness of use has always won. 
After being considered a joke for a while, JavaScript started trending in the mid-to-late 2000s. 
SOAP was all the rage in the back-end world, and so did AJAX on the client side.</p>

<p>SOAP was pretty cool considered what came before. 
Before that, Object Oriented Programming was quite something, 
and OO guys were pretty good at making simple things a lot more complicated than it should : 
instead of calling an endpoint on a remote server, why not pretend the network does not exist, and try to distribute objects ?
Long story short, “Everything Object” failed.
XML was declared the cornerstone of interoperability by enterprise consortiums, and SOAP was built on top of it.<br />
SOAP was basically “how to call a web server through HTTP POSTs, using a specific XML schema as a message structure”.
Because the enterprise world likes predictability, each service comes with a WSDL that describes its interface.</p>

<p>Service Oriented Architecture was buzzing, and we needed a way to consume those “web services” 
directly from “rich client applications”.
In fact, these heavy ass JavaScript pages made sense at the time : everybody did not have huge bandwidth, 
and the more we could put on the client side, the less we had to reload pages, which lead to better user experience.</p>

<p>The problem was that calling SOAP service was made easier by frameworks on the server side (Java, .Net, etc), 
but JavaScript guys could not parse XML as easily as Java guys generated classes. 
When you see how much hacking JS needed to work the same way on every browser, 
you can understand that JS developers did NOT have time to mess around with verbose XML messages. 
They tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">JSON-RPC</a> and then figured out they  could  do even simpler.</p>

<p>The fracture between the enterprise world and the web world started gaping. 
Web guys made the most of out of XHR HTTP Requests, and the easier data format they had, JSON, which happened to be pretty lightweight.</p>

<p>It seems to me that’s when the “public consciousness” realized that HTTP was already an application level protocol. 
People started figuring out that we don’t need another application-level protocol for the messages exchanged, 
we could just pour data directly in HTTP requests/response payloads.</p>

<p>That’s just what it is, we needed remote services, and it happened that HTTP was now everywhere thanks to the web. 
As a bonus, it was firewall and proxy friendly. Those who deployed Java EJBs using RMI know the struggle.</p>

<p>Bottom line, the only thing people needed was calling remote services, both from javascript at the browser level, 
and from server-side applications. 
HTTP happened to be there for a while and easy to use.</p>

<p>And then came up the word REST. I don’t know who in the world dug out Roy Fielding 
<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">thesis</a>. 
That thing had been around since 2000, yet the word went mainstream only in the mid 2000s or so !</p>

<p>Although we commonly call REST is a plain misunderstanding of what the acronym really means, 
it had the benefit of providing some kind of common way to structure an HTTP API.</p>

<p>But what the hell is REST ?</p>

<h2 id="representational-state-transfer-or-the-art-of-giving-complex-names-to-simple-principles">Representational State Transfer, or the art of giving complex names to simple principles</h2>

<p>Let’s summarize it simply, once and for all : REST is a synonym for <strong>browseable</strong>.</p>

<p>Everyone already has a REST API in their good old website.<br />
Most chances are, your website is truly RESTful while your application programming interface is not.</p>

<p>REST is just an abstraction over “how the web works”, 
how a browser interacts with a web server.<br />
All the constraints, details and nitpicking that will follow are corollaries.</p>

<p>“Explaining people how to achieve browseable applications” sounds a lot less sexy than “Representational state transfer”.<br />
As we all know <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html">naming things</a> is one of the hardest things in programming, 
that’s why finding such a catchy name might already be worthy of a PhD by itself.</p>

<p>Let’s break down the major constraints of REST, trying to make light of what they really mean in the process.</p>

<p>If your client needs to <em>understand</em> anything more than the resource format, it ain’t REST.<br />
Why ? because the client will go down any time you alter some resource characteristics.<br />
Does you browser break down when I change HTML tags on my blog’s page ? 
No, because your browser just understands well formatted HTML.
Same goes for atom readers, if an article changes the RSS reader won’t break down unless the resource is made of some invalid XML.
See the trend ? If the server sends back some resource with the correct format, then your client should not break.</p>

<p>With ATOM and HTML, it’s easy to build a REST client (browser), as the media type is targeted toward an end user. 
As a human, you need your browser to format HTML and you can understand what’s going on. 
For DATA, unless your client has some machine learning A.I. $h1t going on, like a crawler, REST is NO USE !</p>

<p><em>And how can I do that for my API ?</em> Dude you probably can’t, unless you extract some kind of abstraction over your data model 
and make it a full fledged media type. And why the hell would you want to do that ? 
you’re probably doing RPC calls, and no one will blame you for that.</p>

<p>Unlike when you click on links to discover new pages, 
your client applications certainly cannot LEARN about new endpoints, 
as they can only understand what they have been coded for.<br />
REST is mostly pointless for machine-to-machine interactions, it was designed for human-to-remote-machine interactions !<br />
I’ll repeat it again : REST is the set of abstract constraints over how websites work !
Unless you are building some kind of AI or crawler like Google, 
which is not what most people are doing, you don’t need HATEOAS. 
All you need is a predetermined and well documented set of endpoints, 
that can provide functions to remote clients. 
Nobody will wander around and browse your corporate Product Management API like they browse 9gag.<br />
Unless, of course, “browseability” is a feature of your application.</p>

<p>To understand why REST was such a major step forward in the way we built applications, 
you have to understand the context it was created in, and the needs it answered.</p>

<p>The <em>hypermedia as the engine of application state</em> thing looks like a detail from now, 
but you have to remember that before the web, network-based applications were built like your voicemail : 
The server had to track <em>state</em> of where the client was in the navigation tree, to propose him option menus (or views).</p>

<p>Hyperlinks and URLs solved that. 
It also solves the complexity of building a desktop application :</p>

<ul>
  <li>No need to manually code all the transitions between views</li>
  <li>No need to store and handle client side state</li>
  <li>No need to keep track of all the distributed versions of the app, since clients get the new version of the application (pages) every time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The funny thing is, most mobile applications are technically a regression from REST.<br />
We don’t need most of the mobile apps we can find on stores, but that’s <a href="/2015/09/25/mobile-apps-madness.html">another story</a>.
They’re just installed applications enhanced for small touch screen. 
Everytime you install an app from the app store, try to picture the old windows installer.</p>

<p>You can set up a RESTful architecture without HTTP and pretty URIs.<br />
In fact, REST does not require HTTP. We can see the web as the reference implementation of REST, 
HTTP being the application protocol behind it, and HTML the principal media-type understood by clients.<br />
I thought about building a RESTful protocol from mainframe apps when working for a bank, 
but in the end I would have just made something worse than HTTP and HTML.</p>

<p>The web is the world of interconnected resources. 
That’s why Dr. Fielding says there’s no such thing as a web service : 
if your service is just an HTTP endpoint, it is not a <em>web</em> service, rather an HTTP service.</p>

<h2 id="the-kosher-bacon-cheeseburger-paradox">The Kosher Bacon-Cheeseburger Paradox</h2>
<p>REST has a number of key constraints that Dr. Roy T. Fielding summed up in an academic (douchy?) manner.</p>

<p>Most religions also have constraints. Here are the constraints of Kosher food :</p>

<ul>
  <li>If it’s pork, it ain’t kosher</li>
  <li>If you mix meat and milk, it ain’t kosher</li>
</ul>

<p>Trying to build a RESTful RPC service is like trying to make a kosher cheeseburger with (pork) bacon : you can’t.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can make it look like a bacon hamburger with turkey bacon.</li>
  <li>You can make it look like a crappy cheeseburger with soy cheese.</li>
  <li>In the end you can’t make anything kosher with beef, cheese and pork at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Same goes for REST:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you break your client by making changes that are still valid within your media type, it ain’t REST</li>
  <li>If you break your client by changing some resource URLs, it ain’t REST</li>
</ul>

<p>The truth is, when you build an HTTP API, your client has <em>expectations</em> on 
both <em>where</em> to find your service, and <em>what</em> it will responds.
That’s perfectly normal, since you’re technically doing RPC : 
the client needs a well defined functionality from your app. 
He calls a remote function passing in some data, and he gets the data he needs in return. 
That expectation of calling a precise function at a given address is precisely “unrestful”. 
Compare it to how you browse a website. 
You don’t know each URL of your favorite meme site, and if one of the pages change it’s fine, 
because unless you bookmarked it you will find it from the site entry point, the main page.<br />
That’s really what hypermedia is about. 
Returning the URL of your service to somebody who already knows it from your documentation isn’t worth the trouble.</p>

<p>HAL is trying to fix a problem very few people actually need to solve : 
why the hell would you put extra effort to make your API RESTish with hyperlinks no-one will follow, 
when all you need is a bunch of HTTP endpoints for your clients ?<br />
Let’s assume our non-restfulness and keep on building cool HTTP APIs. 
The world needed some interoperable standard for inter-application communication, 
and where the enterprise world failed with over engineered protocols, 
the web guys found a solution that was standing right before our eyes with plain HTTP.</p>
