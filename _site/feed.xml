    <description>Coding, american football, and very serious thoughts. Because in France, having an opinion counts more than doing something about it.

        <title>Overcoming Procrastination</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while I’ve been telling myself I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; start writing what’s on my mind about coding, 
and (american) football, and whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like anything you tell yourself that you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do… well you save it for later.&lt;br /&gt;
One of my arguments against my own motivation was that I had too many stuff on my mind, 
and finding where to start is already too much of a challenge for today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because life is full of irony, I’ve been bragging for the last few years that I had developed 
a technique to overcome procrastination (sounds a lot like a motivational speaker, which I’m definitely not).&lt;br /&gt;
Isn’t it the perfect subject to start a blog I’ve kicked aside for a year ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-the-cause&quot;&gt;Understanding the cause&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procrastination is not really a thing, just like laziness.&lt;br /&gt;
Both are just words that put a judgement on symptoms, “not doing something”, instead of understanding &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you “don’t do it”.&lt;br /&gt;
In my case, I found out that I had lofty expectations for the stuff I was procrastinating about.&lt;br /&gt;
I want that thing done so perfectly it becomes a daunting task, I’m overwhelmed.&lt;br /&gt;
The exact thought that flashes through my head when I give up on a task is in fact : &lt;em&gt;This is too much for today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
I can’t speak for everyone, but procrastination doesn’t come when I don’t care, 
it often comes when I ask myself too much at once. 
Speaking in terms of “deadly sins”, the cause of procrastination would not be laziness, it would be vanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution--lowering-the-bar&quot;&gt;The solution : lowering the bar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to “kick my own butt” brought poor results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that has worked so far is &lt;em&gt;lowering the bar&lt;/em&gt; : all you need is too break down your huge task into something smaller.&lt;br /&gt;
Leave your pride aside, you won’t do it well at first. Winning ugly is better than not showing up for the game.&lt;br /&gt;
The most important thing is to get &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; done, event something that may seem insignificant.&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; can be as small as the bare minimum you can do before the sun sets :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if you have to write a letter to appeal a parking ticket (never happened to me), 
just set your objective for today as low as “pulling a sheet of paper and writing my name on it”.  Just that. Once you’ve done it, you can go to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if you have to write up an essay, just ask yourself to create a blank Word file, and save it with a decent file name. Just that. Once you’ve done it, you can go to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if you have to clean up your windows, just ask yourself to clean one window pane in your room. Just that. Once you’ve done it, you can go to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if you have to fix some old code at work, just ask yourself to get &lt;em&gt;one line&lt;/em&gt; fixed before lunch. Just that. Once you’ve done it, you can go to lunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me two things can happen :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get so pumped up that I actually got &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; started that I finish it all at once&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m actually really tired / have something else to do, 
but my brain remembers that I actually started something, 
and the next morning it’s naturally on my mind when I wake up. Since I already started, there is no “entry ticket” anymore, I can get going fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is nothing new to software developers working in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&quot;&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt; environments.&lt;br /&gt;
When you break down a big task into small pieces, each small success fuels your hunger for more success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in most things in life, all you need is to make that one tiny little step, and put all your heart into it. Momentum does the rest.&lt;br /&gt;
My father used to tell me that there is a lot more difference between zero and one, than between one and a million, 
because you can multiply zero with everything you want it’s still 0 (yup, he is the motivational speaker of the family).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal stuff aside, here it is, I got started with my tiny little step, my low hanging fruit, the easiest blog post I could figure out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See ? Now that I have it all figured out with majestuous modesty, I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; proceed to write something highly impressive… but it would be too much for today :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mobile apps madness</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I often hear colleagues and family speak about how big bad internet companies collect their data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I find it highly confusing that these same persons are the ones who blindly give permissions to mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s answer the following questions together :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would you install an application to access your bank accounts on your desktop/laptop computer, instead of using your browser ?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would you give it full access over your files and hardware, for features that will &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; work offline anyway ?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; these features can already be accessed from a website…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;in a device-friendly user interface ?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;without giving up any access to your private data ?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;without taking overpriced diskspace on your overpriced iPhone ?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-phrase-this-another-way--are-you-nuts-&quot;&gt;Let’s phrase this another way : Are you nuts ?!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why bring all that nonsense to your mobile phone, which is just a small touch-based computer loaded with private data ? &lt;br /&gt;
Does that cool looking icon in the app store really makes you lose your mind ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-typing-addresses-is-boring&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But typing addresses is boring”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just put the mobile site in your favorites, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnet.com/how-to/adding-one-touch-bookmarks-to-your-androids-home-screen/&quot;&gt;add a shortcut icon to your homescreen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, do not install an application unless it provides irreplaceable offline features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such features may be :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using a GPS for navigation - NOT localization, ordering your cab can be achieved through a browser !&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stuff with advanced graphics : games, sketching, video editing…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stuff to read offline : books, courses, music/video apps with offline mode…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;professional tooling : payment, docs, spreadsheets…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exception to the offline rule is when you need to get notified (push) in real time : messaging, traffic alerts…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you obviously &lt;strong&gt;don’t&lt;/strong&gt; need to install apps for :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Checking your bank account -&amp;gt; website !&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social networks -&amp;gt; website !&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ordering a pizza -&amp;gt; website, or *shocker* : phone !&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading the news -&amp;gt; website or paper !&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shop online -&amp;gt; website !!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anything that was only a website before smartphones -&amp;gt; website !!!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any promotional offer that requires you to install an app -&amp;gt; just don’t, unless getting spammed makes you feel special&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re probably screwed when it comes to vendors collecting data directly from our operating systems, 
let’s not shoot ourserlves in the foot by opening more doors than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that’s all I have to say for my first post.&lt;/p&gt;
